// COW object is slower to create, but far faster when dealing with object graph
// because it guarantees avoiding of copying.
//
// Swift's primitive dictionary does not provide non-copying object mutation.
// This is a kind of linguistic limitation. We can overcome this limitation partially
// by using COW obejcts. Anyway, it still has its shorcomings...
